# Prompt Framing Approach to Prompt Engineering


# What is the Prompt Framing Approach?

The prompt framing approach is a technique that helps AI understand the context and intent behind a prompt. 
It's like setting the stage for a conversation by providing background information and specifying what you want the AI to focus on. 
This approach is useful when you want to guide the AI to give more accurate and relevant responses.

# How Does It Work?

Set the Context: Provide background information to help the AI understand the situation.
Specify the Task: Clearly state what you want the AI to do.
Give Examples: Provide examples to show the AI what kind of response you are looking for.


Ex. 

# Instructions: Imagine you are a teacher who has known the student for three years. You need to write a letter of recommendation for the student's college application. Highlight the student's academic achievements, personal qualities, and extracurricular involvement.

# Prompt: Write a letter of recommendation for a student applying to college.


# Step-by-Step Instructions

Set the Context: "You are a teacher who has known the student for three years."
Specify the Task: "You need to write a letter of recommendation for the student's college application."

# Give Examples:

Academic Achievements: "The student consistently scored top grades in mathematics and science."
Personal Qualities: "The student is known for their strong work ethic and leadership skills."
Extracurricular Involvement: "The student was the captain of the soccer team and organized community service events."

By following these steps, the AI understands the context, knows exactly what to focus on, and sees examples of the kind of information to include. This helps the AI generate a more accurate and relevant letter of recommendation.

# Benefits of the Prompt Framing Approach

Clear Context: Helps the AI understand the background and situation.
Specific Focus: Guides the AI to address the exact task.
Relevant Examples: Shows the AI what kind of response is needed, leading to more accurate answers.


# Conclusion: 

I learned that the prompt framing approach is a powerful way to make AI understand the context and intent behind a prompt. 
By setting the context, specifying the task, and giving examples, I can guide AI models to give more accurate and relevant responses.
Using the prompt framing approach, I can create better prompts that help AI models generate the specific responses I need.
